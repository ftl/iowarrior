IO-Warrior
==========

This little project combines [Code Mercenaries'](http://www.codemercs.com) IO-Warrior Java SDK with Thomas Wagner's library [IOWJ](http://www.wagner-ibw.de/iowj.html)
into an OSGi bundle. The native parts are available for Microsoft Windows only at the moment. Feel free to contribute the integration for the other supported platforms.

Please see the two projects for further information on how to use the library and the SDK.

Have fun!
