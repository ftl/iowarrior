IO-Warrior
==========

This little project combines Thomas Wagner's library [IOWJ](http://www.wagner-ibw.de/iowj.html) and [Code Mercenaries'](http://www.codemercs.com) IO-Warrior Java SDK 
into an OSGi bundle. The native parts are available for Microsoft Windows (32Bit and 64Bit) only at the moment. Feel free to contribute the integration of the other supported platforms.

Please see the two projects for further information on how to use the library and the SDK.

Have fun!
